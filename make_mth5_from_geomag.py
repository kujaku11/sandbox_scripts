# # Build MTH5 from USGS Geomagnetic data
#
# Its common to look at observatory data for geomagnetic storms or to use as a remote reference.  The USGS provides geomagnetic observatory data for observatories in North America.  In the future this will be expanded to the various other observatories using well developed packages like [geomagpy](https://pypi.org/project/geomagpy/).
#
# You will need to know ahead of time what observatories you would like to download data from, dates, and type of data.  There are no wildcards.  See [USGS Geomagnetic webservices](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/web-service-geomagnetism-data) for more information on allowed options.
#
# Here we will download 2 days of data from 2 different observatories for the x and y components of calibrated data ('adjusted').
